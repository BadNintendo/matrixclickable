# Matrix Game - Read Me

Welcome to the **Matrix Game**! 

In this game, the screen is filled with random numbers (0s and 1s) falling like in "The Matrix" screensavers. Your goal is to **click on the 0s**. 

When you click a 0, a cool effect happens! The numbers scatter like a ripple, then come back together. Each time you click a 0, the game gets a little faster. The numbers get smaller, and it becomes harder to click the next 0.

In the bottom right corner, you'll see your **score** (how many 0s you've clicked). There's also a secret tooltip that shows the time of your clicks in a fun way!

Good luck, and try to click as many 0s as you can before the game gets too fast!
